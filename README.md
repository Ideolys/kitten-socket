# kitten-socket

Socket wrapper with no dependences

## Set client uid

```javascript
  var socket = new Socket(400, '127.0.0.1', {
    uid : 'ec02850a-cccd-470b-9acb-c63c888097c0'
  });
```

If no uid is provided, it is generated by the server at the client connection.

## Activate server logs

```javascript
  var socket = new Socket(4000, '127.0.0.1', { 
    logsDirectory : 'logs', 
    logsFilename  : 'packets.log' 
  });
```
